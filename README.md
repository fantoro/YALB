# Yet Another Last.fm Bot

**YALB** *(or **Y**et **A**nother **M**usic **B**ot)* will be a [Discord](https://discord.com/)
music bot made with [Last.fm](https://last.fm/) scrobbling in mind.

## Why?

I noticed that none of the popular music bots on Discord have any sort of scrobbling feature so I decided to make one that scrobbles myself.

## Planned features

 - [ ] Last.fm account integration
 - [ ] Music playback in Discord voice channels
 - [ ] Support for multiple playback sources
 - [ ] Automatic scrobbling for users in the voice channel who have linked their Last.fm accounts
 - [ ] Last.fm stats commands
